# seek-and-download

It's a simple application to read datasheets with your favorite songs and create a list with the download link instantly.
This needs a lot of work and it's a personal project created ant thought by me.

The big ideia is to create a modular aplication based on your google files.
In my case i needed something to read a datasheet from google to automatically convert my datasheet into a list with the video and the download link of the mp3.
Well... it's already doing that but in a very simple and easy way.

The big ideia here is to use the drive files and then you create your own module and add it to the application. In this case my module is created. But imagine that now you need a module to read your datasheets and convert that data to graphics..!
You just needed to create the module and add it to the application. You got the ideia! :)

I don't have time for this now but i think it is a good ideia. ho... and i created this file just to remember what the hell i've created. XD
